v2.1.5
	Add AC1.3 support and 64bit compatibility
	
v2.1.3:
	Fix updater, added backup utility to restore old files upon updating error
	Fix last lap detection and sending in iRacing
	Move config back into app/python/acSLI/acSLI.ini - has auto detection/moving

v2.1:
	Added current lap display on Page 3
	Delta (page 6 only) now shows last laptime for 3 secs upon crossing start/finish line
	Improved Handshaking Algorithm + implemented in iRacing
	Fixed small memory leak in AC app
	Fixed version handling on handshaker/updater for 3 digit versions
	Fixed inverted mode bugs
	

v2.0.23:
	Fix potential critical handshake bug
	All logs are now in 1 file

v2.0.22:
	Added OPTIONAL brake vibration on brake lockup
	Rewrote iRacing client 

v2.0.17:
	Fix Reliant Robin Incompatibility

v2.0.16:
	Added Laps remaining fuel estimate
	Changed display page 3 to fuel and gear only

v2.0.12:
	Update Optimisations
	Fixes

v2.0.11:
	Try extended updater functions now idna errors are fixed
	
v2.0.10:
	Compatibility Fixes
	Added lapOffset config option under advanced. Is a static value added to the lap count. (by default set to 0 which displays laps COMPLETED, set to 1 to show current lap number)

v2.0.9:
	Fix shift light bug on 98T

v2.0.8:
	Arduino Bug fixes
	inc/dec blinkVal from b8 + b6/b7 on dash

v2.0.6:
	Add changable colours for dash(red to green and green to red) (btn8 + btn2)
	Tweekable Blink Starting Value by editing in .ini file, more work to come with this in the future :P
	Fix conflicts with some apps (ov1 for exmaple)
	Fix more updater bugs

v2.0.4:
	Fix Updater Bugs

v2.0.2:
	Updater Tweeks

v2.0.0:
	Total source rewrite
	Gui for Com Port selection
	Popups for Messages ect
	Automatic Updater
	Improved Customisation
	Option to change tick frequency if its too low(lower frame rate should have a lower tick rate)

v1.8.3:
	Try reduce the RAM usage of arduino program
	Edit config saver/loader in acSLI to fix small bug

v1.8.2:
	Fix EEPROM loading oversight

v1.8.1:
	Added constants in the arduino code to make changing pins easier

v1.8:
	Changed how the module is inverted again, now done by holding button 8 and then pressing button 2 (think of button 8 as a shift key)
	Changed how num of shift lights is changed, now done by holding button 8 and then pressing button 1 (think of button 8 as a shift key)
	Stores both the inversion and shift light setting in EEPROM memory

v1.7.2:
	Added automatic arduino detection and serial port opening to iRacing c# client / debug client

v1.7.1:
	Added variable to invert module easily

v1.7:
	Added remotely configurable intensity, use "--Intensity x" for iRacing startup args
	Added best lap delta to display on new pages 6 and 7, button 8 now changes shift light settings, intensity can only be changed from clients now

v1.6.3:
	AC client now makes its own config.ini so user settings are not lost when updating unless you delete config.ini, it won't be overwritten
	Added default start page feature to AC

v1.6.1:
	Fixed text input to be much more reliable
	Prints all avalible COM Ports to console when connecting to make manually connecting easier 

v1.6:
	Added initial gui in sim to change/reconnect com ports, com port settings and units on the fly
	Modified serial data transfer so speeds over 255xxx don't break the dash
	New args system for iRacing Client, new syntax, arg position interchangable eg "--Port COM5 --Unit KPH"
	iRacing client can now switch between MPH and KPH via args OR check box
	
v1.5:
	Auto Com port detection in Asseto Corsa app

v1.4.1:
	Fixed error in name of a display page on arduino
	
v1.4:
	Changed a display Combination to boost & gear & speed

v1.3:
	Added boost pressure output to the dash

v1.2:
	Streamlined data processing, performance increase

v1.1:
	Added Config File
	Updated sim_info to fix max_rpm always giving '0'

v1.0:
	Initial Release
